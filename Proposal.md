### Tentative project title

-   NYC leading causes of death

### The motivation for the project

-   Recently one of our team members has heard that COVID-19 become the
    second leading cause of death for New York state.
    <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/newyork/ny.htm#lcod>
-   We are interested in what the other leading causes of death are,
    especially in the city of New York where we are currently living. In
    this project, we intended to explore NYC’s leading causes of death
    dataset and NCHS leading causes of death United States dataset.

### The intended final products

-   A report summarizing exploratory analysis results, recommendation
    algorithms used, and predicted leading causes related deaths in NYC
-   A wonderful dashboard giving movie details about the relationship
    between leading causes and deaths.

### The anticipated data sources

-   New York City Leading Causes of Death
    <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam>
-   NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States
    <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states>

### The planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges

-   The biggest challenge is that there is too little reference data
-   Comparisons between causes of death in different places are
    difficult
-   Difficulties in merging different data tables and clear the data
-   The causes of death are too widely distribution

### The planned timeline
